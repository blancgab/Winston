function hw2_Team1(serPort)

    % Bug 2 algorithm application implemented on an iRobot.
    % 
    % The structure of our second homework is based on the TA's solution to
    % the first homework assignment. The robot follows an m-line (set to
    % x=0, along the y-axis, assuming that the robot is pointing in the 
    % direction of the m-line when the program begins). This means that
    % all hit points, leave points and the final goal are set on the 
    % y-axis.
    %
    % This function not only moves the roomba, it also plots the x and y
    % positions as it goes, in a seperate figure. The orientation data is
    % also collected, but for performance reasons, it only gets plotted
    % after the roomba reaches the final or fail states.
    %
    % Note: the orientation graph plots theta over time in polar
    % coordinates, with orientation being thata, and time being rho.
