function hw1_Team1( serPort )

% Autonomous control program for the iRobot Create. When it collides with
% an object, it will circumnavigate the object then returns to its
% original starting position.
%
% Note: In order to ensure that the simulation works both in the simulator 
%       as well in practice using the iRobot, we purposefully set the speed
%       of the iRobot Create to be very slow in order to get very precise
%       positional measurements. This means that the simulation might take 
%       several minutes -- don't use a higher simulation speed, this also 
%       throws off the timing and calibrations of the program.
